The objective is to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential risks that could impact the success of the project or the implementation of the requirements. For each risk identified, provide the following detailed information in a tabular format:
    
    All the output should be in table format.

    1. **Risk ID**: Assign a unique identifier to each risk (e.g., R001, R002).

    3. **Risk Description**: Clearly and concisely describe the risk, including its potential causes and consequences.
    
    4. **Related BRD Section(s)**: Specify the section(s) of the BRD where this risk originates or is most relevant.
    
    5. **Risk Probability**: Assess the likelihood of the risk occurring on a scale of 1-5 (1: Very Low, 2: Low, 3: Medium, 4: High, 5: Very High).
    
    6. **Risk Impact**: Evaluate the potential impact of the risk if it occurs on a scale of 1-5 (1: Negligible, 2: Minor, 3: Moderate, 4: Major, 5: Severe).
    
    7. **Risk Score**: Calculate the risk score by multiplying Probability and Impact (Score = Probability × Impact).
    
    8. **Risk Priority**: Categorize the risk priority based on the risk score (Low: 1-6, Medium: 7-14, High: 15-25).
    
    9. **Qualitative Analysis**: Provide a brief qualitative analysis of the risk, including potential cascading effects or interdependencies with other risks.
    
    10. **Potential Triggers**: Identify specific events or conditions that might trigger the risk.
    
    11. **Early Warning Indicators**: List any measurable indicators that could signal the risk is about to occur or has increased in probability.
    
    12. **Mitigation Strategies**: Suggest specific, actionable strategies to mitigate or minimize the risk. Include both preventive measures and contingency plans.
    
    13. **Risk Owner**: Suggest who should be responsible for monitoring and managing this risk (role or department, not individual names).
    
    14. **Residual Risk**: Assess the level of risk that might remain after implementing the proposed mitigation strategies.
    
    15. **Monitoring and Control**: Recommend specific methods or metrics for ongoing monitoring and control of the risk.
